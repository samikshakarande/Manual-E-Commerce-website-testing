As a fresher with a strong passion for quality assurance, I embarked on a 6-month internship at Design Techno to gain practical experience in software testing. During this internship, I had the opportunity to work on a manual testing project focused on an e-commerce website.

Project Overview:

Duration: 2 months

Company: Design Techno

Objective: To thoroughly test the functionality and user experience of an e-commerce website.

Key Modules Tested:

Login:

I conducted rigorous testing of the login module, ensuring that users could successfully log in with valid credentials while encountering appropriate error messages for invalid inputs.

Logout:

Registration:

I thoroughly tested the registration process, validating that users could create accounts successfully, and their information was stored securely.

Approach:
I followed a systematic approach to testing, including test case design, execution, and defect tracking. I meticulously documented test cases and their outcomes to resolve any identified issues promptly.



Skills Acquired:

Proficiency in manual testing methodologies.

Bug reporting and defect tracking.

Collaboration with development teams for issue resolution.

Attention to detail and a commitment to quality assurance.

This project allowed me to gain valuable hands-on experience in the field of software testing and reinforced my passion for ensuring the reliability and usability of digital products. I am now eager to apply my skills and knowledge to new opportunities in the software testing domain. Please feel free to explore the project on my GitHub for more details aexamples of my work.
